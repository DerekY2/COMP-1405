>>> school = 'Private School'
>>> school[:1]+school[11:]
'Pool'
>>> phrase = 'So, long and thanks for all the fish'
>>> phraseList = phrase.split('h')
>>> phraseList
['So, long and t', 'anks for all t', 'e fis', '']
>>> len(phraseList)
4

a) 22
b)len()
c)at index 3, there's nothing in it. perhaps it happened because it split at the h and expected further output but there was nothing else, so it was left null


>>> day = '     Carpe diem     '
>>> day.strip()
'Carpe diem'
>>> day.strip()[2:8]
'rpe di'
